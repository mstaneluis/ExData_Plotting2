# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
# Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission 
# from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

# first, access the Work file

# Aggregate by sum the total emissions by year
Totals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,NEI, sum)
